# Anton Ihoshyn — Backend Developer

I’m a backend developer focused on building clean, reliable, and production-ready services using Python. My main experience is in Django and Django REST Framework, where I design APIs, work with authentication and permissions, and structure projects with maintainability in mind. I pay a lot of attention to clean, maintainable code, separating business logic into service layers and improving error handling.

- Django
- Django REST Framework
- REST API design

**Databases/Storage**
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Redis

**Infrastructure / Async**
- Celery
- Redis as broker / cache
- Docker

## What I Can Build

- REST APIs with authentication & role-based permissions
- CRUD systems with filtering and pagination
- Background jobs and async processing
- Rate limiting and request analytics logic
- Data aggregation and deduplication services
- Clean project architecture (services, utils, separation of business logic)
- Dockerized development and deployment environments

---

## Engineering Principles I Follow

- Clear separation of concerns
- Business logic outside of views
- Readable and predictable code
- Defensive handling of edge cases
- Tests where they add real value
- Awareness of state and side effects

## Current Focus

- Backend architecture and API design
- Gradual transition into AI-related backend work:
    - learning how to integrate AI/ML models into backend services
    - working with model inference APIs, data pipelines, and background processing\
    - building reliable, secure, and maintainable AI-enabled systems
- Improving problem-solving speed and accuracy
- Writing production-oriented Python code
